# House-Escape-LD38
This is a little puzzle game I made for ludum dare 38.

You can see the submission page here:

or play it in your browser on itch.io:

**Feel free to use any part of source code in your project without crediting me.**

However I'd advice you to not use original graphics, sounds and unity map files for other projects. 
If you really need to ask me in an email.

Some parts of the project are really messy because of time limitations (the game was made in 48 hours), 
but I made my best to keep key scripts like `Player.cs`, `TextDrawer.cs` and `CameraMovement.cs` encapsulated and easy to read.
You can copy it to any Unity project and they will work just fine.
## How to run
If you have Unity3d engine installed on your computer, click `File->Open Project...`and choose this project from the list.
